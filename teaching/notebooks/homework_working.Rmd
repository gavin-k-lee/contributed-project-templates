### Exercise 1

Run a linear regression between any two variables in the `mtcars` dataset.

```{r mtcars}
summary(mtcars)
```

```{r lm}
ols <- lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$cyl)
```

### Exercise 2

Reverse the dependent and independent variables and run the linear model again. Compare the estimate slope variables of each of the two regressions you have performed.

```{r reverse}
reverse <- lm(mtcars$cyl ~ mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r compare}
print(ols$coefficients[[2]])
print(reverse$coefficients[[2]])
```

### Exercise 3

Calculate the sum of the residuals of each of the regressions. What do you find?

```{r resids}
sum(ols$residuals)
sum(reverse$residuals)
```
